I am a student pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIIT-Hyderabad and have been pursuing research under <a href ="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/asharma/">Dr. Avinash Sharma</a> at Centre for Visual Information and Technology (CVIT) in IIIT-H. I am interested in 3D and 4D human reconstruction using various sensors, and exploring deep learning methods for the same.

I have been working on a Multiview RGBD Capture Setup at CVIT. I have worked on depth camera calibration, RGB and depth calibration and fusion algorithms. I have also worked on 3D garment retargeting for virtual tryon.
